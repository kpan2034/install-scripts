# Install Scripts

_To make your system wipes less scary to deal with after._

Contains install scripts for my workflow when starting from scratch.

Setup i3-gaps with zsh with oh-my-zsh, polybar, rofi, compton, powerline, wal & betterlockscreen.

Fix rtl wifi drivers on Ubuntu.

Also has a script for some of the cli stuff I use, mostly python packages:
- howdoi
- idea
- movie-cli
- quote-cli
- football-cli
- youtube-dl
- neofetch
- instantmusic
- dotfiles

## Usage

Make the script executable and run the relevant script, preferably in your home directory.
Example:
```
chmod u+x i3-script.sh
./i3-script.sh
```

For the wifi driver : Check out [lwfinger/rtlwifi\_new](https://github.com/lwfinger/rtlwifi_new/) to find the driver of your choice and change it in the scripts accordingly.
